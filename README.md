# (WHITELIST ALPHA) Galactic Drive - Custom 1.12.2 modpack based on Warpdrive.

**DEV GUIDELINES**

**Downloading the current pack dev build:** Open the development branch, download the current ZIP, and add it as a profile to one of the following launchers.

https://gdevs.io/ (Recommended)

https://curseforge.overwolf.com/

https://multimc.org/#Download

When you want to make new edits, you must commit to the development branch or a branch you create. **NEVER COMMIT DIRECTLY TO MAIN.** After this, you can add the commit to an exisiting pull request or make your own from your commit, which will allow all of us to view the edits and make changes collaboratively on the branch first before pushing the commit onto the main branch after approval. **After a pull request has been created, further commits can be added to the pull request by commiting to the branch the pull request was made on.** The main branch contains our unmolested current version from which we work from in a dev "bubble". Whenever you create a pull request, add it to the project for the version in dev, and apply the correct labels. You can perform personal testing on your own branches, we must ALWAYS keep an intact main repository from which to pull our testing environments from.

**ALPHA TESTER GUIDELINES**

**1.** Testers are required to submit a "report" via a comment on an issue dedicated to them every time the are on the server. Create an issue, label it with TESTER REPORT PAGE and add it to the project for the current version. You will edit this issue to add reports. Reports must start with the date you are writing it on. The more you get done and the longer you are on depends how long the report has to be. Please check the example issue for a reference.

**2.** Testers are required to log into the server at least every other day, unless you contact us with an express reason.

**3.** The reports are non-negotiable. Any bit of feedback/data you get will be useful and is needed.

**4.** Your reports must include:

     A) Any bugs/dupes/exploits you find.
     
     B) Any recipes that you think need changed, made more difficult, etc.
     
     C) Any suggestions for the pack progression/branching on progression. We want to provide variety.

**5.** If you are only online for a short period of time, you may submit your report noting that you were AFK or did not do much. You MUST still submit the report every time you are on, no matter how little data you got if any.
