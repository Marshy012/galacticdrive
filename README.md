# (WHITELIST ALPHA) Galactic Drive - Custom 1.12.2 modpack based on Warpdrive.

**DEV GUIDELINES**

**Downloading the current pack dev build** Actual build releases will not have this process.
1) Open the development branch, and download the current ZIP.
2) Take the contents of the folder within the downloaded ZIP, and move them/rezip them such that they are at the root of the ZIP. MultiMC is the only launcher that read the ZIP as it is downloaded.

When you want to make new edits, you must commit to the development branch or a branch you create. Commiting to main is disabled. After this, you can add the commit to an exisiting pull request or make your own from your commit, which will allow all of us to view the edits and make changes collaboratively on the branch first before pushing the commit onto the main branch after approval. The main branch contains our unmolested current version from which we work from in a dev "bubble".

Whenever you create a pull request, add it to the project for the version in development, and apply the correct labels. You can perform personal testing on your own branches, we must ALWAYS keep an intact main repository from which to pull our testing environments from.
