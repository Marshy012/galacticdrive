# Galactic Drive - 1.12.2 modpack based on WarpDrive.

**This modpack is currently in alpha stages. Expect incomplete concepts and possibly bugs until an official release is made.**
<br />

The general goal of Galactic Drive is to create a Solar System/environment where all of the planets are inhospitable warzones, and the safest place to be at all times is in Space. You can create space stations and ships with WarpDrive, which you can "jump" across the Solar System or through Hyperspace to visit various planets for resources. You can also "cloak" your ships/stations, and protect them from other players with turrets and various other counter-measures. You will need to visit each planet on multiple occasions to gather specific resources. Many things within the modpack are gated behind certain resources on certain planets, and you will always need more of them. 

Check out the [WIKI](https://github.com/zediious/galacticdrive/wiki) to keep updated on what the pack contains. You can also view commits in version branches.

The current stable modlist can be viewed by taking a look at the [MANIFEST](https://github.com/zediious/galacticdrive/blob/main/manifest.json)

# Downloading the modpack. 

> **1) Click the following link to visit the Galactic Drive releases page and download the latest version by clicking the following link [RELEASES](https://github.com/zediious/galacticdrive/releases).
> This ZIP can be added to any modpack launcher to download and launch the modpack.**
> 
> **2) If you wish to test the current version in development, you can download the ZIP for the in-dev version's branch by clicking the following link [IN-DEV VERSION](https://github.com/zediious/galacticdrive/archive/refs/heads/0.2alpha.zip)
> This link will change to reflect the current development version.**
>
> **3) If you are using MultiMC, you can just add the dev ZIP as an instance and load up the pack. If you are using any other launcher, take the contents of the
> folder within the downloaded ZIP, and move them/rezip them such that they are at the root of the ZIP. MultiMC is the only launcher with the ability to read the ZIP
> recursively to find the pack files. This ONLY applies if you have downloaded a development build. Pack builds from the releases tab can be added normally to any launcher.**

The modpack will be added to CurseForge when I deem it in a complete state.
