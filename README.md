# Galactic Drive - Custom 1.7.0 modpack based on Warpdrive.
**DEV GUIDELINES**

Every user on here has a branch dedicated to them. Whenever you make edits, you will push your commit to YOUR branch, NEVER TO MAIN. After this, you will create a pull request from your commit, which will allow all of us to view the edits and make changes collaboratively on the branch of the person who committed first before pushing the commit onto the main branch after approval. The main branch contains our unmolested current version from which we work from in our own little "bubbles" Whenever you create a pull request, add it to the Galactic Drive Dev project, and apply the correct labels. You can perform personal testing on your own branches, we must ALWAYS keep an intact main repository from which to pull our testing environments from.

**2.** Testers are required to log into the server at least every other day, unless you contact us with an express reason.
