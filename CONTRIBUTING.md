# Collaborator Guidelines


When you want to make new edits, you must commit to the development branch or a branch you create. Commiting to main is disabled. After this, you can add the commit to an existing pull request or make your own pull request from the commit, which will allow all of us to view the edits and make changes collaboratively on the branch first before I push the commit onto the main branch. The main branch contains our unmolested current version from which we work from in a dev "bubble".
<br />

Whenever you create a pull request, add it to the project for the version in development, and apply the correct labels. You can perform personal testing on your own branch or fork, we must ALWAYS keep an intact main repository from which to pull our testing environments from.
